This solution contains sample code used for the book,
  Ext.NET Web Application Development, by Anup Shah

All the code comes as-is with no warranty or guarantee of any kind.

You are free to play with the code, modify and adapt it as needed.

Please note that there may be variations in the code compared to the
samples printed in the book. This can be for a number of reasons, e.g.
- Updating defects/changes to reflect the changes to Ext.NET as the
  book was being written
- Reorganizing namespaces for easier legibility when printing
- etc.

The folders generally reflect functional areas. MVC controllers and
views are used by different chapters. Some shared code is also used
by different chapters or reused against controllers and particular
folders.

The code is compiled against the latest Ext.NET 2.1 code as of writing.
It is not a NuGet reference at the moment, and should be updated to
the official Ext.NET 2.1 release (or later) when available.
